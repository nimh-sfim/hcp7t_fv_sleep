# Project Description

This repository contains the code used in the publication "Temporary Title" that investigates the potential value of ultra-slow fluctuations around 0.05Hz in inferior ventricular regions as a marker of light sleep when fMRI-data is available. This work relies on the publicly available 7T resting-state sample from the human connectome project.

Information about software requirements and how to run this code can be found on the [project wiki](../../wiki).
